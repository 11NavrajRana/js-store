         <p>hi I am jyotsana rana master designer originating from Dehradun, India. I began designing at the age of 15 and i love to design cloths and its my passion from childhood. Over the next 6 years, I worked and learned the skills and design clothes. At the age of 22, I became a (co-founder) of js creation and my partner sonika thapa  was interested in jewellery designing have been making amazing garments and jewellery for our customers. On January 1st, 2022, I will celebrate 6 years of designing and experience. Over these years, I had the pleasure of taking my skills to people of my hometown. I design garments for my friends, family and lovely people of my hometown gaining valuable experience learning new techniques, modern design and store management skills. I became knowledgeable about the designing culture, and types of garments products. After two year of designing practices for friends & family, I began the journey with sonika thapa of running our own company, . My elder brother Navraj and parents enjoy helping with the business and I look forward to passing on my designing knowledge to the people and let them get indulge in superb designing garments from js creation.</p>
